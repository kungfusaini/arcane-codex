Some of my favourite moments from this year are directly because of 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. Not only did I
find the novel thoughtful and inspiring, but it truly gave me better perspecitve on the world around me, what
I want from my life, and the person I want to be. Although the text itself on the surface is very simple, for
me, it triggered emotions that I hope to capture in my writing.
