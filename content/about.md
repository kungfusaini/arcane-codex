# The Arcane Codex  
### *Compiled Texts for the Modern Mage*  

{{< emph >}} Magic has changed {{< /emph >}}. What was once a practice hidden in dusty tomes is now open and available to all. The
medium has evolved too, as technology now allows us to wield power once thought impossible. Computer commands are like spells after all.

The modern mage should study two kinds of magic — the logic of machines and the wonder of the world. They
are a master of technology, and able to make it perform their wishes, but remembers to stay grounded in
reality. After all, what point does mastery of the digital domain have if one looses touch with their
humanity?

This Codex is a chronicle — of experiments, thoughts, and experiences. Some entries are technical, others are personal, and some stand to explore the world we live in. I hope you can learn something new, or gain some inspiration.

Open a page, and read what’s been compiled.  
The Codex is ever-growing — as all good magic should.
