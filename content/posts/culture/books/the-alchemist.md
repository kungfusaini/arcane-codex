Some of my favourite moments from this year are directly because of 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. Not only did I
find the novel thoughtful and inspiring, but it truly gave me better perspecitve on the world around me, what
I want from my life, and the person I want to be. Although the text itself on the surface is very simple, for
me, it triggered emotions that I hope to capture in my writing.  

Note:
> I encourage you to read the book before this codex entry. I will be divulging major plot points.

The story follows a young man named Santiago. He lives life as a shepard, and although he is content with his
current life, he hears a whisper that something much greater awaits him. After hearing this, he tries to shake
the feeling that he could be doing something more with his life, but it sticks in his mind. {{< emph >}} "You
could be more..."{{< /emph >}}. So, he sets out on his quest to find what his true purpose in life is. There
are many setbacks along the way, but he stays steadfast and eventually he finds what he is looking for. 

Santiago did not initially become a shepard out of chance. He chose to become one against the wishes of his
parents because he wanted to travel. He wanted to see the world for all that it is, and longed for the freedom
that a life on the road can give. As mentioned, he was content with this life, but he had become comfortable. 


You alwasys become the shepard.
